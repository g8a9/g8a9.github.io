      <description>Prometeo Desktop Prometeo is a Windows desktop application, written in C#. It allows its user to exchange files and folders across the LAN in a peer-to-peer architectural model. Every user in the network that has the application can act both as a client and as a server. The actual exchange of data involves two stages. Initially, an UDP-based communication protocol is used to search other peers on the LAN, as well as to periodically signal its own presence.</description>
